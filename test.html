<p style="text-align: justify;">Many have heard of market analysis. A few companies jump on the research train Did you know that many large multinationals have their own department for <strong>marketing analysis</strong> ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job of managing a small or medium-sized company requires mastering an array of information. It is essential to know the current conditions are in the field, what issues or trends we're facing and what are the next steps we need to undertake, without risk and with a greater profit margin. .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Particularly, when we think about a market analysis, the thing we're trying to determine is how commercially viable of a particular economic project (a new service, product or business venture). But the truth is that behind a thorough market analysis there is much more data that can be helpful for future research or marketing plans .</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is market analysis</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Market <strong>analysis</strong>is the collection of information on customers, competitors, and the market in which we intend to expand in general, which will provide further information. After analyzing the data, more information is obtained, such as market trends, the positioning of the company, its product, etc.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why should a company conduct an analysis of its market</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data analyzed will serve as a backup to decision-making, which could be vital to the success of the company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What can the information gathered from the market analysis help us?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Key information for business survival</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can be used to determine the approximate effectiveness rate of the launch of a brand new product into the market and to design a unique business strategy for each market or segment,. It can also assist in making some other decisions, like the amount to invest in an item.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Define your target audience</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally we'll be able to gather all the necessary information to know the profile of our target audience: demographic information as well as knowing what their challenges or requirements are, what they think, the way they search for goods or services, and reasons why they prefer the competition. In this way we can know how the typical customer would be and how to access him.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Decide on the price</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the desired target and market where the product is to be launched are known and established, we can to determine the price more precisely, which is an important indicator for keeping up with competitors and productivity costs.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The idea can be developed at various times and with different objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, market research can be conducted throughout the life of the product, which can help detect deviations from the plan of marketing. However, as a principle, market studies provide significant returns on investment.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Make sure you are able to back the investment</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A market study can be the difference between launching the right product or creating one that fails, being able to lose a lot of money. This is the reason it is preferable to know in which products to invest.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Market research, the basis for a marketing mix plan</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The market analysis isn't only utilized to formulate the marketing strategy, but it will help to create a solid <strong>marketing mix strategy</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After designing the product with a particular target audience, the data obtained will help determine where and how the product should be distributed, the manner in which it should be advertised as well as the best cost for covering the costs and also adjust to the position or appearance of the product we want to transmit to the user.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Methods to create a market study</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How to start an analysis of market trends?</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Define the format</strong>that your document must have <strong>and also decide the method you will use to collect the data</strong>. Before beginning the long and tedious study, determine the points of your study and consider what your sources may be (surveys, interviews and direct observation, as well as government sources, statistics report, specialist magazines and reports, etc.). It is essential to alter your study to a methodology that is as close as possible to that used by professionals so that you can really achieve good results.</li>
<li><strong>Determine what the purpose for the analysis</strong>. Based on the motivation that leads you to do it, you will apply certain variables or other. For example, to learn what response the new line of products will have, which in turn broadens the scope of business for the company, we'll need to update our information about current and potential customers.</li>
<li><strong>Set a budget:</strong>You must be realistic. The research that a market analysis requires requires spending time and resources. It is crucial to think about the length you'd like to travel to determine how much to invest.</li>
<li><strong>Study the competition:</strong>A great place to start is to study how the competition is acting in relation to what is working and what's not working, to discover what the trends in the market are. On the internet, there is a lot of data that we can collect using interesting professional tools for analysis of positioning, like Semrush, Woorank or Ahrefs. In this respect you must be aware that around 75% Internet users consult the reviews as well as the opinions of other users before purchasing a product according to The Association for Media Research (AIMC).</li>
<li>Watch the behaviour of your consumers' behavior. This is why, by making use of different tools, for example, conducting in-depth conversations with online surveys or discussions groups, you'll be able to determine the areas of the current consumer's attention in relation to their buying behaviors, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many professionals make use of monitoring tools like Google Analytics to know the user behavior on their website and by doing this, to know which products they like the most, where they leave their shopping carts or bounce rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have followed these steps, create a SWOT analysis in which you identify the threats and opportunities of markets, as well as the company's positioning in addition to determining your weaknesses and strengths are. This matrix can be used to complement these conclusions with your CAME analysis, a methodology that comes from the word Correct Confront, Maintain, and Exploit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to emphasize that the market study does not ensure that the product will be successful but it <strong>helps reduce the risk associated with investing</strong>. This is why an analysis of the market will be essential prior to the release of the product, as well as continuous monitoring of the achievement of objectives and the approval of the item on the market of reference.</p>
